Hello Spicy Participant,

For this experiment, we will be using the following process:

1. Record a 3 minute baseline - eyes closed. Filename: Firstname-Baseline1-eyesclosed. Example: Alex-Baseline1-eyesclosed.csv

2. Record a 3 minute baseline - eyes open. Filename: Firstname-Baseline2-eyesopen. Example: Alex-Baseline2-eyesopen.csv

3. Record watching the following video for 3 minutes, starting at the 43 second mark. Filename: Firstname-Youtube. Example: Alex-Youtube.csv

Note: Please open the video first to make sure that youtube will not be showing commercials and set it to 43 second mark. When you are ready to start recording, start the video and start the recording.

4. Record reading the following article for 3 minutes. Filename: Firstname-Article. Example: Alex-Article.csv
