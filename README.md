# project-spicy

Welcome to Project Spicy, home of the NeurotechSF Spicy Challenge for May, 2021.

To get started uploading data, please check PROTOCOL.MD. Currently, we are collecting spicy data that will be used on the 5/20 hack night. The protocol file has been updated with the latest steps.

We will shortly have tutorials, jupyter notebooks, and google collab links with populated data so that anyone interested can replicate the analysis.

For additional questions please DM @amilenkovic on NeurotechX slack.
