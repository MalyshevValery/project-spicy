Hello Spicy Participant,

Updated 5/19 for Spicy Collection:
For this experiment, we will be using the following process. We will record a baseline with either eyes open or closed, and match it during the experimental data collection. If you prefer to collect data eyes open, please record the baseline with eyes open so that it matches the experiment. If you prefer to do the baseline and collection with eyes closed, that also works. The goal is to have consistent baseline / experiment comparison.

Please record one baseline that will match the conditions during the experiment. Please select either 1 or 2.
1. Record a 5 minute baseline - eyes closed. Filename: Date-Firstname-Baseline-eyesclosed. Example: 05192021-Alex-Baseline-eyesclosed.csv
-or-
2. Record a 5 minute baseline - eyes open. Filename: Date-Firstname-Baseline-eyesopen. Example: 05192021-Alex-Baseline-eyesopen.csv

For the spicy data collection, please prepare your spicy item of choice. It's ok to use food or liquids as available, both should be fine for the experiment. Please do not use spice levels that would cause you serious levels of distress or pain. If the intensity of the sensation is such that it causes profuse sweating it will most likely render the data unusable. Moderate amounts of capsaicin that generate a response but are tolerable are ideal. Please record the stimulus in the following two ways:

1. Consume the spicy item and begin a recording. In this case, the full onset will not be visible in the data, but will be used for contrast against baseline. One of the points of discussion has been whether the food will be kept in the mouth during this period or whether it will be removed before recording start. It is easier from a data standpoint if the food is chewed or swished, then removed, and then the recording started. Please record a 5 minute file. Filename: Date-Firstname-SpicyBeforeStarting.csv

2. Consume the spicy item halfway through a recording. This will be a noisier recording and will be harder to interpret, it could also yield at interesting contrast. Start a 5 minute recording and consume the spicy item roughly at the halfway point. For food this will cause significant motor artifacts, but we can use this as a way to try to remove or reduce them. For liquids a straw may be a good way to minimize mouth movements. Please record a 5 minute file. Filename Date-Firstname-SpicyDuringRecording.csv

If possible please record files in csv format, xdf or edf should also work.

And this data should be uploaded to the data folder, please create a subfolder in the format of Firstname-data. Example: Alex-data
